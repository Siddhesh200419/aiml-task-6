# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification - AI & ML Internship Task 6

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To implement K-Nearest Neighbors classification using the Iris Dataset and understand instance-based learning.

## ðŸš€ Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## ðŸ“ˆ Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the Iris dataset.
2. Normalized features using `StandardScaler`.
3. Used `KNeighborsClassifier` from `sklearn` to train models with different K values.
4. Evaluated model using accuracy and confusion matrix.
5. Visualized decision boundaries (using 2D features).

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation
- Best Accuracy: 96.67% with K=3
- Confusion matrix and classification report included.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Used built-in Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
